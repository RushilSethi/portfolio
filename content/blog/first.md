# Building My First Dev Portfolio

I recently built this portfolio using Hugo and the PaperMod theme. Here's a look into my development process and what I learned along the way.

## Why This Approach?

As a developer starting out, I chose to build with Hugo and PaperMod rather than creating from scratch. This decision let me focus on what matters most right now - documenting my projects and learning journey. While I plan to build a custom portfolio in the future, having a clean, functional site up and running helps me showcase my work today.

## The Development Journey

Building this site expanded my technical toolkit in several ways:
- Diving into static site generation
- Setting up a development environment with Go and Hugo
- Implementing continuous deployment with GitHub Actions
- Managing content through markdown and front matter
- Exploring Hugo's templating system and partial layouts
- Optimizing for performance and SEO

## What's Next

This site will grow with me as I continue learning. I'm excited to:
- Add more projects as I build them
- Start writing about my learning experiences
- Explore new web technologies
- Share interesting coding challenges I solve

## Current Projects

Check out my [projects page](/projects) to see what I'm working on. I'll be updating it regularly with new work and side projects.

Feel free to connect with me on [GitHub](your-github) or [LinkedIn](your-linkedin) to follow my development journey!
